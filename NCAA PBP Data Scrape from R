## Load baseballR, tidyverse and stringr
library(stringr)
library(baseballr)
library(tidyverse)

##Lookup School ID, University Illinois-Chicago Example
school_id_lu(school_name = "UIC")

## Get Schedule Info for Team with ID, Year
UIC <- get_ncaa_schedule_info(teamid = 302, year = 2019)

##Run For Loop to get PBP data from baseball R web scrape and attach to dataframe <schoolname>pbp
UICpbp <- list()
> for (i in 1:nrow(UIC)) {
     UICpbp[[i]] <- get_ncaa_baseball_pbp(UIC$game_info_url[i])
 }

##Organize PBP Data into another dataframe (not sure why we do this step) 
UIC19 = plyr:: ldply(UICpbp, data.frame)

##Create a new individual batter column from the description field with Stringr manipulation 
UIC19$batter <- word(string = UIC19$description, start = 1, end = 2)
UIC19$batter <-str_remove(UIC19$batter, "walked")
UIC19$batter <- str_squish(UIC19$batter)

##Remove Pitcher Subs from Description column with If/Else statement to filter out a pitching event from hitting data
UIC19$batter <- if_else(str_detect(UIC19$description, "to p for") == 'TRUE', 'NA', UIC19$batter)

##Create action column that shows only the play by play that ocurred 
UIC19$action <- str_extract(UIC19$description, "struck out swinging | flied out | homered|singled|popped out| grounded out| walked| infield fly|hit by pitch|reached on fielder's choice")
